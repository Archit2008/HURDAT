\usage{
EP_wind_radius
}
\description{
Recorded wind radius data for each observation, where available. This
     data frame is substantially smaller than its sibling "details" data
     frame because many storms simply had no data. Where there is a record
     means at least one of the wind radius variables have an integer value.
